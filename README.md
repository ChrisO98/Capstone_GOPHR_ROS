# Capstone_GOPHR
Texas A&M - Senior capstone project code of the mobile robot GOPHR (Ground Operating Patient Helper Robot).

This repository contains the top portion of GOPHR code; The bottom portion of GOPHR (chassis) was handled by my teammates.

GOPHR's ROS files. These files were used on a Raspberry Pi 4 4gb running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with a installment of Ubuntu Desktop using tasksel and LightDM, and ROS Noetic.

Download and place the 'froze_east_text_detection.pb' file into gophr_hardware/scripts
